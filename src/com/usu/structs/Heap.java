/**
 * Heap is a binary tree
 * - it is complete. This means it is completely filled in, reading from left to right
 * across each row, although the last row need not be full.
 * - it is (usually) implemented as an array rather than using references to
 * connect the nodes.
 * - each node in a heap satisfies the heap condition, which states that every nodeï¿½s
 * key is larger than (or equal to) the keys of its children
 * 
 * in Java, we can use PriorityQueue instead of Heap
